                                A mother’s love is everything. It is what brings a child into this world.
                                It is what molds their entire being. When a mother sees her child in danger,
                                she is literally capable of anything.
                                A mother’s love is the strongest energy known to man.
                               
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                                    When your mother asks, ‘Do you want a piece of advice?’ it’s a mere formality.
                                    It doesn’t matter if you answer yes or no. You’re going to get it anyway.

                                but you always went out of your way to make sure that I was well taken care of too.
                                I really appreciate your kindness.

                                adventure. You're always making me feel special because you have no obligation to spend
                                time with me,
                                but you do anyway.

                                From saying I Hate You during childhood to I Miss You during college to
                                Thank You right now – we both have come a long way.
